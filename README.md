### ZecZec Crowdfunding - Success Rate Prediction
> *This is a school project, aiming to learning statistical NLP methods.*

Our research focuses on the relationship between Social Media Narrative(SMN) of crowdfunding projects (e.g. the introduction images and text) and their success rates.

In conclusion,
- We utilized CKIP NLP toolkits to preprocess introduction text contents and implemented statistical methods for vectorization (tf, tf-idf) and feature selection (Chi-square, LogLikelihood, PCA).
- At the end, we achieved 89% F0.5 score with Chi2 + Naive Bayes Classifier through examination on ML models.
